/*
 * Warning - CSS hacks below *
 
 These are required due to IE 6 & 7 bugs when rendering nested lists.
 IE renders large margins above nested lists, but oddly renders properly when
 the list items have a top border of at least 1px.
 
 Because taxonomy_filter has no way of knowing what background color your 
 theme uses for this block the borders need to be transparent. Unfortunately
 IE6 doesn't understand transparent as a border color.
 
 I would welcome any theme independent ideas on how to avoid using these hacks

  /* This rule is skipped by IE6 and below due to the child selector
  IE 7 will apply the border and avoid its bug. Other browsers will also apply
  the border but it should be harmless unless that browser doesn't support
  transparent border colors. */
